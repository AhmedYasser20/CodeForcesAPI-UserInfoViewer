## How to use

To use the application, simply enter the username of the Codeforces user you want to look up in the input field provided and click the "Submit" button. The application will then make an HTTP request to the Codeforces API to retrieve the user's information, and display it in a table below the input field.

The table includes the user's handle, rating, rank, maximum rating, and country. If the user is currently participating in a contest, the table will also display their current rating and rank in the contest.
